## Instructions to start the project:   
1. Spinning up the devserver can be done with `npm start`
1. Storybook is also installed and can be run with `npm storybook`   

### Storybook:   
I've installed this to continue development after being blocked from an API (and I was not sure if I would get unblocked... below I explain more)

### Notes about OpenStreetMaps API:   
I've used open street maps for geocoding.  
It's a free API that can be used to get coordinates from places.  
I've had a nice live results implementation, but I've soon been blocked for making too many requests...  

_**⚠️ So, a little warning below!**_   
Try to not make too many queries in a short period, else you'll probably be blocked too ;)   
If it happens you can open the app from another IP on a mobile hotspot for example.

## Notes about code:   
This was my first real Typescript project.  
It was a nice journey discovering Typescript and learning more about React hooks.  
The typechecking helps a lot to spot bugs beforehand and Hooks makes the code shorter and easier to read.   
Typescript was more straightforward than I thought. I had to get used to the syntax a bit, but I think it went quite well!
